conducts
========

Modjam 3 project!  Add Nethack-like conducts to Minecraft.


This is a mod that adds no blocks or items.  Instead it adds a new achievements 
page filled with a set of conducts.  Conducts are like anti-achievments that
record what you did NOT do in your game of Minecraft.  The idea is that by 
avoiding common actions, like eating meat, or punching trees, you are
challenged to find new ways to play.

This mod:
- Adds 14 new conducts on a new achievements page
- Changes the pop-down for these achievements to indicate that you've broken a conduct
- Adds buttons to the death screen to check your achievements and statistics

For the future:
- Add a command or button to reset your conducts
- Change the word "Taken!" on the achievements page
- More conducts!  Please share your ideas
